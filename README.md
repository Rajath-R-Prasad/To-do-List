# To-do List
The To-Do List is a simple yet essential project that reinforces fundamental web development concepts while introducing real-world project structures. This project helps in understanding CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), user interactions, and data persistence.

## Key Learnings:

- DOM Manipulation: Handling user inputs, adding/deleting tasks dynamically.

- Event Handling: Responding to user actions like clicks and keyboard events.

- Local Storage (if used): Saving tasks persistently in the browser.

- Styling & UI/UX: Enhancing user experience with CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap.

- Version Control: Managing project files using Git & GitHub.
